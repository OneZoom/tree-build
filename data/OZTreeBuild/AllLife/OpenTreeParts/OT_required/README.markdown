This folder can contain OpenTree .nwk subtrees which are missing from the newest Open Tree, but
needed for tree building. These files need to be provided by hand (usually from older versions
of the OpenTree. They should be copied to the `../OpenTree_***` folders (e.g. `../OpenTree_all`), 
from where they well be cut down to `.phy` files.We should check if later versions of the OpenTree render these bespoke files obsolete
