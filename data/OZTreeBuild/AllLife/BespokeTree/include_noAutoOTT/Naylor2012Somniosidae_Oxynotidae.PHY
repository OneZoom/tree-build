[Arrangement from 'Elasmobranch Phylogeny: A Mitochondrial Estimate Based on 595 Species' (https://doi.org/10.1201/B11867-9 see http://sharksrays.org). NB, the Somniosidae/Oxynotidae 
clade from sharksrays.org should also include Centroscymnus & Proscymnodon, but these are hard to include
from the opentree, as they are marked as non monophyletic, so have simply been omitted (yuck)
