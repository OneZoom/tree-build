[The Cryptomycota and Microsporidia are grouped according to http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23932404, together with the Aphelidea (see http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00112/abstract). Note that in draftversion 4 these are absent from the tree due to 'incertae sedis'. Hopefully this will be corrected in version 5.
