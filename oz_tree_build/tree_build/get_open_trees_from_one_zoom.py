"""
Create subtrees from the OpenTree, on the basis of ott numbers in a set of newick files.

Usage: getOpenTreesFromOneZoom.py OpenTreeFile.tre output_dir file1.PHY file2.PHY ...

This script places a set of inclusion files into output_dir, based on the names of nodes
in the input .PHY files. The input files should contain one or more node names in the OneZoom
@include format which is the scientific name + '_ott' + (an OTT id, optionally a ~ sign, and
optionally other OTT numbers separated by an minus sign) + '@', e.g. Brachiopoda_ott826261@
This specifies that the node should be replaced with part of the OpenTree: namely the subtree
starting at ott node 826261.

E.g.
    foobar_ott123@
        create a node named foobar with ott 123, consisting of all descendants of
        ott 123 in the opentree.

    foobar_ott123~456-789-111@
        create a node named foobar with ott 123, using ott456 minus the descendant
        subtrees with ott 789 and 111 (the tilde sign can be read an a equals, used
        as Dendropy doesn't like equals signs in taxon names.

    foobar_ott123~-789-111@
        shorthand for foobar_ott123~123-789-111@

    foobar_ott~456-789-111@
        create a node named foobar without any OTT number,
        using ott456 minus the descendant subtrees 789 and 111

The actual inclusion is done by the build_oz_tree.py. This script merely creates the
files to include. It does this by extracting the relevant subtree from the full OpenTree
